       "content": "Soldering jewelry-scale metals seems scary at first, but it can be done at your kitchen table without a large investment. A small butane torch is fine for smaller pieces. You will need a flame-proof work surface (metal or ceramic works best) and a small soldering brick or pad. You need a piece of clean metal - I recommend starting with 20 or 22 gauge copper and advancing to other metals as you gain experience. You also need solder, and flux to keep the metal clean of oxidation until the solder flows. These are the must-have's. Of course there are many other tools and supplies that are useful, but it's possible to get started with just these basic items. In my next post, I'll demo a small-scale piece to show you how it works.",
